We value the unique experiences and perspectives that each person brings to The Trade Desk, and we are committed to fostering inclusive spaces where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work every day.

Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a dynamic, globally- connected team where your contributions will make a meaningful difference in building a better media ecosystem? Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small- to medium-sized workplaces globally.

What you will do:

Lead Software Engineers serve both as technical individual contributors and people managers. You will be optimizing your own code, as well as making sure that your reports are able to optimize theirs.

Working on the developer tooling, processes, and productivity means speeding up all of engineering by improving the efficiency of the development process across all aspects. We design and implement processes and tools that impact everybody and help the organization continuously scale. If you're the kind of engineer who says ""I want to fix that"", or ""I can see how we can make experience of our engineers better"" whenever you encounter a problem, then come join us. We focus where we can have the most impact in monitoring, observability, on-call tooling and incident management processes. The Trade Desk's platform pushes the boundaries of modern software engineering and keeping it balanced requires tools and processes that do the same.

Some of the work that you will be doing to help us deliver on our mission is:


Build new features and components in our monitoring tools, processes, and services
Improve existing features and components to increase efficiency across our engineering organization
Review code from your peers and grow others through example, mentorship, leading and teaching
Drive complex changes involving multiple components
Build components and processes that are used by other engineers across the organization

Who you are:

You have a sustained track record of leading engineers with a wide range of experience, while also making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful software projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you & your team are doing.

You are a driver. You will be driving technical projects and providing leadership in a ground-breaking and fast-paced environment. This includes task planning and conducting code reviews, as well as individual code contribution.

You care deeply about improving developer experience, tools, and engineering

processes

You drive innovative solutions while being sensitive to the current needs and realities of

your fellow engineers

You have 7+ years of software development, engineering experience plus a Bachelor’s/Master’s level degree in computer science or relevant

Experience working in large codebases, organizing and refactoring
Experience with configuration management
Experience with continuous integration and continuous deployment
Experience with configuration and management in cloud / virtualization environments (AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, et al)

A variety of technical opportunities is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a software engineer, which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start.

What we care about is that you can learn quickly and find solutions to complex problems using the optimum tools for the job. What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We are not seeking engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent answers no one has thought of yet and find answers to the questions yet to be asked.

The goal of the Database team is to make it incredibly easy to build scalable, reliable applications that depend on Figma's Database. This team is also responsible for exposing the database architecture as a platform, giving developers insights into how they are using the databases and ways that can improve that interaction. How easy it is to use these interfaces is directly related to how productive Figma engineers feel.

Scaling our Database architecture is both a complex and exciting task that is essential for Figma's success. Check out this blog that talks about how we addressed some of the growing pains of databases at Figma and gives a peek into the future work.

We’re a team of very thoughtful engineers who like to spend time together at the whiteboard thinking about the right way to build systems to be reliable and maintainable.

What you’ll do at Figma:

Design, build and operate scalable data systems and services that power Figma’s innovative tools for design and collaboration.
Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes.

Experience building and scaling distributed systems as an individual contributor and/or Team Lead
Proven track record of building, scaling, and shipping high-quality products in high growth environments.
Experience communicating and working across functions to drive solutions.

Have excellent problem solving skills. You use a systematic and thorough approach. You think from first principles and have a bias for action.Are driven by impact. You are willing to work on grungy problems if they have a high impact on the business or the health of the infrastructure.
Care deeply about the quality of the software / systems you build. You have an artisan mentality and are always looking to improve your craft. At the same time you are able to strike the right balance between idealism and pragmatism.
Have excellent technical communication skills.
Finally, Figma is a close-knit company with a strong culture that promotes inclusivity and collaboration, taking ambitious goals and having fun doing so. You deeply value these traits and see yourself actively contributing to it. 

At Figma, one of our values is Grow as you go. We believe in hiring smart, curious people who are excited to learn and develop their skills.

How easy it is to use these interfaces is directly related to how productive Figma engineers feel.

Scaling our Database architecture is both a complex and exciting task that is essential for Figma's success. Check out this blog that talks about how we addressed some of the growing pains of databases at Figma and gives a peek into the future work.

About SafelyYou

SafelyYou is an extremely mission-driven company that raised $60m in 2021 through series A and series B financing and is now rapidly scaling. Our company spun out of the UC Berkeley AI Research Lab and develops artificial intelligence to support care for those with Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, and other cognitive impairments. Alzheimer’s disease is the single most expensive disease in the US, costing an estimated $600b per year in direct and indirect costs. It affects 1 in 3 people over 85 and 1 in 9 people over 65. Our first product is focused on reducing the frequency and impact of falls, the leading cause of hospitalization for those living with dementia. We have peer-reviewed results showing up to 80% fewer falls with an average of 40% fewer falls and 80% fewer ER visits from falls. We've raised capital from top VC firms, including Founders Fund, Eclipse, Foundation Capital, and Data Collective, and the largest providers in the space are actively using, expanding, and evangelizing the service. We have also been awarded grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, given the national importance of the issue – as the population continues to age, the global costs of Alzheimer’s and dementia are expected to double over the next 10 years. With fewer and fewer young people available to provide the care needed, we must find a way for technology to bridge the gap.

Your Role at SafelyYou

You will be responsible for ensuring the resilience of the fleet software and all the related systems to ensure the safety of our residents. The reliability, performance, and security of your code will be critical factors in enabling our company's growth. You will be closely collaborating with our operational teams and SRE to meet our customer demand and growth while opening up opportunities for innovations.

Responsibilities:

Design and implement efficient, scalable, and reliable backend systems that support our fleet management initiatives
Collaborate with product owners, designers, and other engineers to develop new features and functionality
Develop and maintain our backend APIs that support both internal and external customers
Write high-quality code that is well-documented, thoroughly tested, and maintainable
Develop and maintain frontend applications that provide a rich user experience
Own the technical design and architecture of projects within our domain
Take a role in driving tech initiatives, technical design and architecture, planning, and delivery of our initiatives
Mentor other engineers on the team, and provide feedback on code and architecture reviews
Participate in on-call rotation to ensure that our services are highly available and performant

The Ideal Candidate

MS or Ph.D. in CS, Math, Physics, or equivalent real-world experience
7+ years of experience as a software engineer, with a focus on backend development and a microservices architecture
Experience with deploying and managing edge devices at scale, preferably cameras
Expertise with Go and Typescript
 A Strong Generalist Engineer with a team-oriented mindset focused on delivering high-quality and scalable solutions.

Grow Therapy is on a mission to serve as the trusted partner for therapists growing their practice, and patients accessing high-quality care. Powered by technology, we are a three-sided marketplace that empowers providers, augments insurance payors, and serves patients. Following the mass increase in depression and anxiety, the need for accessibility is more important than ever. To make our vision for mental healthcare a reality, we're building a team of entrepreneurs and mission-driven go-getters. Since launching in February 2021, we've empowered more than ten thousand therapists and hundreds of thousands of clients across the country and insurance landscape. We've raised more than $178mm of funding from Sequoia Capital, Transformation Capital, TCV, SignalFire, and others.

About the Role

As an early engineer at Grow, you'll have a huge amount of scope and autonomy. You get to see a number of different product surface areas (provider portal, marketplace, client experience, infrastructure, and enabling operations) in addition to working full-stack (Flask/Python on the backend, React/TypeScript on the frontend, infrastructure on AWS).

What you'll do

We have multiple roles open. Some examples of projects you may work on include: 

Making a robust cost estimation and eligibility checking platform - You'll pull in data from different sources and implement the logic and infrastructure that allows us to give cost estimates for every insurance type our providers accept. 
Creating a world-class note-taking experience for providers - Notes are where our providers spend most of their day! You'll own the full-stack experience of notes syncing, intelligent prefilling, and caching notes to create a best-in-class experience. 
Optimizing search ranking and performance at scale - there are thousands of providers who accept many different insurance types, have unique backgrounds, and differing amounts of availability. Help us create a search algorithm that matches clients with the right therapist for them! 

Who you are

4+ years in engineering. You've built and scaled systems, made complex engineering decisions, and have proved out your technical skills in industry. 
Full-stack web development experience. You have experience working with REST APIs, web frameworks, an understanding of HTML, CSS, JS and at least one backend language. 
Entrepreneurial spirit. You have worked in a startup or on your own side projects and built products from the ground up. 
Product thinker. You want to build through a user-centric lens and be involved not only in engineering decisions but product and design decisions as well. 
Leader. You'll do anything to achieve your goal. You know how to think on the fly and persist through setbacks and roadblocks and to motivate your teammates to do the same. 
Team Player. You are collaborative by nature, relish in camaraderie and group wins, and are looked to by colleagues as a steadfast partner and source of encouragement 
Highly Motivated. You want ownership of your work. 

Bonus Points

Experience with React, TypeScript, and GraphQL 
Python and Flask Experience

Engineering team principles

You own what you build. You will feel ownership of the code you write, articulate the importance of the feature, and follow up to ensure it's successful. 
We build solutions for our providers and clients. We write code to solve user problems, not just for the sake of solving technical problems. 
You are not part of the tech team, but rather part of the team itself! Grow is a tech-enabled business and not a pure software business, so understanding how the business works is integral to your job. 

The salary range for this position is $180,000 to $220,000 per year.
